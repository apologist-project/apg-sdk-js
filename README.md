## Installation

```sh
npm i -s apologist-agent
```

## Reference

A full reference for this library is available [here](https://github.com/apologist-project/apg-sdk-js/blob/HEAD/./reference.md).

## Usage

Instantiate and use the client with the following:

```typescript
import { ApologistAgentClient } from "apologist-agent";

const client = new ApologistAgentClient({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
await client.chat.createChatCompletion({
    "key": "value"
});
```

## Handling errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API,
or if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),
a subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
const pet = await client.pet.update({ name: 'doggie', photoUrls: ['string'] }).catch(async (err) => {
  if (err instanceof Apologist.APIError) {
    console.log(err.status); // 400
    console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError
    console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}
  } else {
    throw err;
  }
});
```

Error codes are as follows:

| Status Code | Error Type                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |
| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |

### Retries

Certain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.
Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict,
429 Rate Limit, and >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.

You can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Configure the default for all requests:
const client = new Apologist({
  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2
});

// Or, configure per-request:
await client.pet.update({ name: 'doggie', photoUrls: ['string'] }, {
  maxRetries: 5,
});
```

### Timeouts

Requests time out after 1 minute by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Configure the default for all requests:
const client = new Apologist({
  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 1 minute)
});

// Override per-request:
await client.pet.update({ name: 'doggie', photoUrls: ['string'] }, {
  timeout: 5 * 1000,
});
```

On timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.

Note that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).

## Advanced Usage

### Accessing raw Response data (e.g., headers)

The "raw" `Response` returned by `fetch()` can be accessed through the `.asResponse()` method on the `APIPromise` type that all methods return.
This method returns as soon as the headers for a successful response are received and does not consume the response body, so you are free to write custom parsing or streaming logic.

You can also use the `.withResponse()` method to get the raw `Response` along with the parsed data.
Unlike `.asResponse()` this method consumes the body, returning once it is parsed.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
const client = new Apologist();

const response = await client.pet.update({ name: 'doggie', photoUrls: ['string'] }).asResponse();
console.log(response.headers.get('X-My-Header'));
console.log(response.statusText); // access the underlying Response object

const { data: pet, response: raw } = await client.pet
  .update({ name: 'doggie', photoUrls: ['string'] })
  .withResponse();
console.log(raw.headers.get('X-My-Header'));
console.log(pet.id);
```

### Logging

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All log messages are intended for debugging only. The format and content of log messages
> may change between releases.

#### Log levels

The log level can be configured in two ways:

1. Via the `APOLOGIST_LOG` environment variable
2. Using the `logLevel` client option (overrides the environment variable if set)

```ts
import Apologist from 'apologist';

const client = new Apologist({
  logLevel: 'debug', // Show all log messages
});
```

Available log levels, from most to least verbose:

- `'debug'` - Show debug messages, info, warnings, and errors
- `'info'` - Show info messages, warnings, and errors
- `'warn'` - Show warnings and errors (default)
- `'error'` - Show only errors
- `'off'` - Disable all logging

At the `'debug'` level, all HTTP requests and responses are logged, including headers and bodies.
Some authentication-related headers are redacted, but sensitive data in request and response bodies
may still be visible.

#### Custom logger

By default, this library logs to `globalThis.console`. You can also provide a custom logger.
Most logging libraries are supported, including [pino](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino), [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston), [bunyan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan), [consola](https://www.npmjs.com/package/consola), [signale](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signale), and [@std/log](https://jsr.io/@std/log). If your logger doesn't work, please open an issue.

When providing a custom logger, the `logLevel` option still controls which messages are emitted, messages
below the configured level will not be sent to your logger.

```ts
import Apologist from 'apologist';
import pino from 'pino';

const logger = pino();

const client = new Apologist({
  logger: logger.child({ name: 'Apologist' }),
  logLevel: 'debug', // Send all messages to pino, allowing it to filter
});
```

### Making custom/undocumented requests

This library is typed for convenient access to the documented API. If you need to access undocumented
endpoints, params, or response properties, the library can still be used.

#### Undocumented endpoints

To make requests to undocumented endpoints, you can use `client.get`, `client.post`, and other HTTP verbs.
Options on the client, such as retries, will be respected when making these requests.

```ts
await client.post('/some/path', {
  body: { some_prop: 'foo' },
  query: { some_query_arg: 'bar' },
});
```

#### Undocumented request params

To make requests using undocumented parameters, you may use `// @ts-expect-error` on the undocumented
parameter. This library doesn't validate at runtime that the request matches the type, so any extra values you
send will be sent as-is.

```ts
client.pet.update({
  // ...
  // @ts-expect-error baz is not yet public
  baz: 'undocumented option',
});
```

For requests with the `GET` verb, any extra params will be in the query, all other requests will send the
extra param in the body.

If you want to explicitly send an extra argument, you can do so with the `query`, `body`, and `headers` request
options.

#### Undocumented response properties

To access undocumented response properties, you may access the response object with `// @ts-expect-error` on
the response object, or cast the response object to the requisite type. Like the request params, we do not
validate or strip extra properties from the response from the API.

### Customizing the fetch client

By default, this library expects a global `fetch` function is defined.

If you want to use a different `fetch` function, you can either polyfill the global:

```ts
import fetch from 'my-fetch';

globalThis.fetch = fetch;
```

Or pass it to the client:

```ts
import Apologist from 'apologist';
import fetch from 'my-fetch';

const client = new Apologist({ fetch });
```

### Fetch options

If you want to set custom `fetch` options without overriding the `fetch` function, you can provide a `fetchOptions` object when instantiating the client or making a request. (Request-specific options override client options.)

```ts
import Apologist from 'apologist';

const client = new Apologist({
  fetchOptions: {
    // `RequestInit` options
  },
});
```

#### Configuring proxies

To modify proxy behavior, you can provide custom `fetchOptions` that add runtime-specific proxy
options to requests:

## Frequently Asked Questions

## Semantic versioning

This package generally follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:

1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.
2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals.)_
3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.

We take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.

We are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/apologist-project/apg-sdk-js/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.

## Requirements

TypeScript >= 4.9 is supported.

The following runtimes are supported:

- Web browsers (Up-to-date Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and more)
- Node.js 20 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.
- Deno v1.28.0 or higher.
- Bun 1.0 or later.
- Cloudflare Workers.
- Vercel Edge Runtime.
- Jest 28 or greater with the `"node"` environment (`"jsdom"` is not supported at this time).
- Nitro v2.6 or greater.

Note that React Native is not supported at this time.

If you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.

## Environments

This SDK allows you to configure different environments for API requests.

```typescript
import { ApologistAgentClient, ApologistAgentEnvironment } from "apologist-agent";

const client = new ApologistAgentClient({
    environment: ApologistAgentEnvironment.Default,
});
```

## Request and Response Types

The SDK exports all request and response types as TypeScript interfaces. Simply import them with the
following namespace:

```typescript
import { ApologistAgent } from "apologist-agent";

const request: ApologistAgent.ListChatCompletionsRequest = {
    ...
};
```

## Exception Handling

When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of the following error
will be thrown.

```typescript
import { ApologistAgentError } from "apologist-agent";

try {
    await client.chat.createChatCompletion(...);
} catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof ApologistAgentError) {
        console.log(err.statusCode);
        console.log(err.message);
        console.log(err.body);
        console.log(err.rawResponse);
    }
}
```

## Advanced

### Subpackage Exports

This SDK supports direct imports of subpackage clients, which allows JavaScript bundlers to tree-shake and include only the imported subpackage code. This results in much smaller bundle sizes.

```typescript
import { ChatClient } from 'apologist-agent/chat';

const client = new ChatClient({...});
```

### Additional Headers

If you would like to send additional headers as part of the request, use the `headers` request option.

```typescript
import { ApologistAgentClient } from "apologist-agent";

const client = new ApologistAgentClient({
    ...
    headers: {
        'X-Custom-Header': 'custom value'
    }
});

const response = await client.chat.createChatCompletion(..., {
    headers: {
        'X-Custom-Header': 'custom value'
    }
});
```

### Additional Query String Parameters

If you would like to send additional query string parameters as part of the request, use the `queryParams` request option.

```typescript
const response = await client.chat.createChatCompletion(..., {
    queryParams: {
        'customQueryParamKey': 'custom query param value'
    }
});
```

### Retries

The SDK is instrumented with automatic retries with exponential backoff. A request will be retried as long
as the request is deemed retryable and the number of retry attempts has not grown larger than the configured
retry limit (default: 2).

Which status codes are retried depends on the `retryStatusCodes` generator configuration:

**`legacy`** (current default): retries on
- [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
- [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
- [5XX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses) (All server errors, including 500)

**`recommended`**: retries on
- [408](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408) (Timeout)
- [429](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) (Too Many Requests)
- [502](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/502) (Bad Gateway)
- [503](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503) (Service Unavailable)
- [504](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/504) (Gateway Timeout)

Use the `maxRetries` request option to configure this behavior.

```typescript
const response = await client.chat.createChatCompletion(..., {
    maxRetries: 0 // override maxRetries at the request level
});
```

### Timeouts

The SDK defaults to a 60 second timeout. Use the `timeoutInSeconds` option to configure this behavior.

```typescript
const response = await client.chat.createChatCompletion(..., {
    timeoutInSeconds: 30 // override timeout to 30s
});
```

### Aborting Requests

The SDK allows users to abort requests at any point by passing in an abort signal.

```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
const response = await client.chat.createChatCompletion(..., {
    abortSignal: controller.signal
});
controller.abort(); // aborts the request
```

### Access Raw Response Data

The SDK provides access to raw response data, including headers, through the `.withRawResponse()` method.
The `.withRawResponse()` method returns a promise that results to an object with a `data` and a `rawResponse` property.

```typescript
const { data, rawResponse } = await client.chat.createChatCompletion(...).withRawResponse();

console.log(data);
console.log(rawResponse.headers['X-My-Header']);
```

### Logging

The SDK supports logging. You can configure the logger by passing in a `logging` object to the client options.

```typescript
import { ApologistAgentClient, logging } from "apologist-agent";

const client = new ApologistAgentClient({
    ...
    logging: {
        level: logging.LogLevel.Debug, // defaults to logging.LogLevel.Info
        logger: new logging.ConsoleLogger(), // defaults to ConsoleLogger
        silent: false, // defaults to true, set to false to enable logging
    }
});
```
The `logging` object can have the following properties:
- `level`: The log level to use. Defaults to `logging.LogLevel.Info`.
- `logger`: The logger to use. Defaults to a `logging.ConsoleLogger`.
- `silent`: Whether to silence the logger. Defaults to `true`.

The `level` property can be one of the following values:
- `logging.LogLevel.Debug`
- `logging.LogLevel.Info`
- `logging.LogLevel.Warn`
- `logging.LogLevel.Error`

To provide a custom logger, you can pass in an object that implements the `logging.ILogger` interface.

<details>
<summary>Custom logger examples</summary>

Here's an example using the popular `winston` logging library.
```ts
import winston from 'winston';

const winstonLogger = winston.createLogger({...});

const logger: logging.ILogger = {
    debug: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.debug(msg, ...args),
    info: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.info(msg, ...args),
    warn: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.warn(msg, ...args),
    error: (msg, ...args) => winstonLogger.error(msg, ...args),
};
```

Here's an example using the popular `pino` logging library.

```ts
import pino from 'pino';

const pinoLogger = pino({...});

const logger: logging.ILogger = {
  debug: (msg, ...args) => pinoLogger.debug(args, msg),
  info: (msg, ...args) => pinoLogger.info(args, msg),
  warn: (msg, ...args) => pinoLogger.warn(args, msg),
  error: (msg, ...args) => pinoLogger.error(args, msg),
};
```
</details>


### Custom Fetch

The SDK provides a low-level `fetch` method for making custom HTTP requests while still
benefiting from SDK-level configuration like authentication, retries, timeouts, and logging.
This is useful for calling API endpoints not yet supported in the SDK.

```typescript
const response = await client.fetch("/v1/custom/endpoint", {
    method: "GET",
}, {
    timeoutInSeconds: 30,
    maxRetries: 3,
    headers: {
        "X-Custom-Header": "custom-value",
    },
});

const data = await response.json();
```

### Runtime Compatibility


The SDK works in the following runtimes:



- Node.js 18+
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Workers
- Deno v1.25+
- Bun 1.0+
- React Native


## Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code,
otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as
a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening
an issue first to discuss with us!

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
